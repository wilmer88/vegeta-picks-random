Was asked to code the javascript on the index.html given by the the bootcamp instructor.
When you open index.html in browser, you can see written password generator and inside the the box you'll see a smaller box with secure password and a generate Password button.

My job was to create prompts that asks the user, what criteria(numbers,letters and special charters) the user wants in the password that is going to be generated
